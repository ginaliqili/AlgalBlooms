This is the stable release for the beginning stages of a new web application project for the EPA that we are trying to receive a grant from.
The research project attempts to incorporate a research model for determining parameters for lake health (Cyanobacteria county, Chlorophyll-A concentration,
turbidity, etc.) into the web tool display. Basic visualization functionality has been stubbed out in this code, but research model has not been incorporated yet,
which is why values will show up as NaN.

I built this app from beginning to end as part of an EPA research project proposal with the Virginia Tech Geography and Statistics Department during December and January 2016/2017. 
The project authors will include Dr. Yang Shao, Dr. Xinwei Deng, Dr. Drew Ellis, and myself. 

The current online web application is available at http://ginali.xyz/algalblooms.

To run and view this code locally, follow these steps:

1) Install the XAMPP software. XAMPP is a local Apache distribution that allows your local laptop or computer to serve as a web server.

https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html

2) Once XAMPP is installed, start up the XAMPP control panel and click "start" on Apache.

3) Save the code in this repository to C:/xampp/htdocs/AlgalBlooms 

4) Open Chrome browser (or Safari, but works best in Chrome) and navigate to localhost/AlgalBlooms. The web tool should display and work fully.
